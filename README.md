# Tower of Hanoi

A simple implementation of the old [Tower of
Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) game using Rust. Just some
simple practice to familiarize myself with the language.

My hope is to someday implement a method to find the shortest route to solve
any game given any number of towers and rings, but rather than coding it
directly into this project, I'm instead trying to make pathfinding its own
library to be implemented to any project I so choose. So yeah, tbd on that.
